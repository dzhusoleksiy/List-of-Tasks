This app was built with React and is fully responsive. I designed it myself, with the help of Tailwind CSS. The app offers users all the necessary features, including adding, editing, and deleting tasks, as well as changing their status. Each stage of the process is meticulously polished to ensure an intuitive experience. Additionally, React-Toastify was utilized to enhance its usage.

I am a Front-End Developer, and that is why interactions with the server are simulated with the help of an appropriate array of objects. This process was also improved by the usage of PropTypes. Last but not least, the entire app was divided into components, allowing for easy reusability and enhancing understanding for those who wish to review the source code.
