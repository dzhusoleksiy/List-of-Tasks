# React To-Do List App

This app was built with React. It is fully responsive and was designed by me with the help of Tailwind CSS. This app provides users with all the necessary features, such as adding new tasks, editing them, and changing their status. Each and every stage of that process is polished to make the experience as intuitive as possible. Furthermore, it was enhanced with the usage of React-Toastify.

I am a Front-End Developer, and that is why interactions with the server are simulated with the help of an appropriate array of objects. This process was also improved by the usage of PropTypes. Last but not least, the whole app was obviously divided into components for better understanding by those who would like to check the source code.
